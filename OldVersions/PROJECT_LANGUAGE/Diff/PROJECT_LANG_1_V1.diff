++ Project language file 1
++ For: seanpm2001/Learn-Diff
++ About:
++ I decided to make Diff the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Diff) as Diff is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Diff programming language. It only makes sense to Diff the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
